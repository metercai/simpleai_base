# SimpleAI Base package
# Announce
Yesterday, I suddenly received a message forwarded to me by a friend. simpleai_base was reported and StabilityMatrix issued a security alert stating that SimpleSDXL's dependency on simpleai_base poses a security risk. So it is necessary to issue a statement here: 
- <b>simpleai_base has been open source since its birth, with every step of evolution, including minor code changes during development and debugging, recorded on Git. Binary code is also automatically compiled through actions on GitHub. Adhering to a completely transparent security policy, it can withstand any questioning and verification. 
- We are willing to accept any supervision and friendly suggestions, continuously improve, and adhere to the bottom line of open source in innovative practices. </b>

# 声明
昨天很突然的收到朋友转发给我的信息，simpleai_base被举报，由StabilityMatrix发布了安全提示，认定SimpleSDXL依赖的simpleai_base有安全风险。所以有必要在此发布声明：
- <b>simpleai_base从一开始就是开源的，每一步的演变，包括开发调试过程的微小代码变更都记录在git上面，二进制代码也是在github上通过action自动编译的。遵循了完全透明的安全策略，可以经得起任何质询和检验。
- 我们愿意接受任何监督和友好建议，持续改进，在创新实践中坚守开源的底线。</b>
